AD7280a_SPICommnunication
=========================

This Arduino project can communicate with AD7280a using SPI bus and a modified linux driver.
The original source of the linux driver is http://wiki.analog.com/resources/tools-software/linux-drivers/iio-adc/ad7280a.
The setup is tested with Evaluation Board EVAL-AD7280AEDZ. http://www.analog.com/en/evaluation/EVAL-AD7280A/eb.html.
